# Build-a-Context-Aware-LLM-Agent-Using-LangChain

## Objective
Design and implement your own LLM-powered agent using the LangChain ecosystem. This agent should:

Use at least one tool
Incorporate function-calling
Integrate LangSmith for observability
Implement a fallback mechanism
Bonus: Use the Agentic library to define a clear multi-step workflow

## Use Case: Travel Planner Agent
✈️ Agent Goal:
Plan a trip by finding flight information, estimating trip cost, and recommending tourist attractions. If the tool/API fails, it falls back to a simple language-based response.
